// Email sending logic for SOH reference deletion will be handled
// directly within the /api/soh/references/[referenceId]/delete-request route.
// Keeping this file might cause confusion or conflicts.
// If a generic email sending utility is needed in the future,
// it can be created as a lib function rather than an API route.
