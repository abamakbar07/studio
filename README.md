# StockFlow: Efficient Stock On Hand Management

StockFlow is a web application designed to streamline and manage stock-on-hand (SOH) data, physical stock counting processes, and user access control within an organization. It features role-based access, approval workflows, and a clear interface for managing stock-take operations.

## Key Features

*   **Role-Based Access Control:**
    *   **Super Administrator:** Configured via environment variables, primarily approves new Super User registrations through email links.
    *   **Super User:** Manages Admin Users, approves their registrations, and oversees their own set of Admin Users.
    *   **Admin Users:** Specific roles (Admin Input, Admin Document Control, Admin Verification) with tailored permissions for different stages of the stock-take process.
*   **User Registration & Authentication:**
    *   Secure registration for Super Users and Admin Users.
    *   Email verification for all new user registrations.
    *   Password hashing using `bcryptjs` for secure credential storage.
    *   Database-driven login with session management via HTTP-only cookies.
*   **Approval Workflows:**
    *   New Super User registrations require approval from the Super Administrator via a unique URL sent by email.
    *   New Admin User registrations require approval and subsequent activation by their designated Super User through the User Management dashboard.
*   **SOH Data Management (Initial Setup):**
    *   Placeholder for SOH data file uploads (e.g., `.xlsx`).
    *   Foundation for processing and utilizing this data for stock counts.
*   **Forms Management (Initial Setup):**
    *   Placeholder for generating stock count forms based on SOH data.
    *   Tracking form statuses (Printed, Counting, Finished, Verified, Inputted).
    *   Interface for inputting physical count data.
*   **User Management Dashboard:**
    *   Super Users can view, approve, activate, deactivate, and delete Admin Users associated with them.
*   **Basic Reporting (Placeholder):**
    *   Initial UI for displaying stock variance and form completion charts.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
*   **UI:** ShadCN UI Components, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
*   **Database:** Firebase Firestore
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (partially, for SDK initialization), Custom logic with bcryptjs
*   **Email:** Nodemailer
*   **GenAI (Planned):** Genkit (for potential future AI-driven insights)

## Setup & Running Locally

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and populate it with the necessary Firebase configuration details, email server settings, and application-specific variables:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (replace with your project's credentials)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-xxxxxxxxxx

# Email Configuration (for Nodemailer)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
# This is the email address that receives approval requests for new Super Users
ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL=muhamad.afriansyah@dsv.com

# Application URL (important for generating verification/approval links)
# For local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:9002 
# For production, replace with your deployed app's URL
```

**Note:** The `ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL` is crucial for the Super User approval workflow.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in your `package.json` dev script).

## Important Notes

*   **Password Security:** Passwords are now hashed using `bcryptjs`.
*   **Session Management:** The current session management uses basic HTTP-only cookies. For production, consider a more robust solution like `next-auth`.
*   **Firebase Security Rules:** Ensure your Firestore database has appropriate security rules configured to protect user data and control access.
